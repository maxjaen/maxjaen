### Hello there, my name is Max!

As a full stack software engineer, I build technology solutions that solve complex problems and create real value for users and organizations. My goal is to develop software that makes a meaningful impact â€” whether by improving processes, enhancing user experiences, or driving innovation.

I specialize in both front-end and back-end development using languages like Java, Python, and TypeScript, and frameworks such as Spring, Angular, and React.

While I have a strong preference for web technologies, what matters most to me is working in a purposeful environment with people who are as passionate about building great software as I am.
