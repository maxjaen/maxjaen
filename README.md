### Hello there, my name is Max!

As a full stack software engineer in the health industry, I build technology solutions that improve patient care and healthcare processes. Its my goal to create software that adds value to healthcare organizations and their patients.

I specialize in both front-end and back-end development using languages like Java, Python, and Typescript, and frameworks like Angular (and React on a more basic level).
